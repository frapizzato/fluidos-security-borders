# Protected Borders in FLUIDOS

Welcome to the repository containing the code for the **intent-based** solution for **protected-borders** developed by Politechnic of Turin as a contribution of the [FLUIDOS](https://fluidos.eu/) European project.

The material in this demo is organized as follow:
- the subproject `node` references the repository containing code and information for the FLUIDOS Node
- the folder `demo` contains scripts and manifest that are used for the demo
- the folder `code` contains the code implementing the protected border solution
- some tentative documentation is contained within the folder `docs`. Here you may also find the schema used for the intents and some examples.

Note that the FLUIDOS node has been modified to install Calico CNI. More speficically, the following files have been modified:
- `node/tools/scripts/setup.sh` to modify kind installation using Calico CNI
- `node/quickstart/kind/standard.yaml` to disable default CNI and setup Calico Pod's subnet
- `node/tools/scripts/environment.sh` to modify kind installation including the Calico CNI step
- `node/quickstart/utils/calico-custom-resources.yaml` to modify Calico installation so that it's comptible with Liqo as detailed in the docs [liqo installation](https://docs.liqo.io/en/latest/installation/install.html#installationcniconfiguration)


## Demo Setup

<!--The demo is located in the folder: `demo_da_presentare/node_main`.-->

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Starting the Environment

To start the demo environment, we invite to use the testbed environment provided in the [node documentation](./node/docs/installation/installation.md). 
<!-- To retrieve the submodule correctly, use the git command `git submodule update --init --recursive`. --> Here is a short list of requires steps:

- Navigate to the `node/tools/scripts/` folder and execute the setup script:
  ```bash
  cd node/tools/scripts/
  ./setup.sh
  ```
- Select `1`, to use the defaul number of clusters, and then confirm with `y`, to work with your local repository, building locally all the components, and installing Calico. While deny with `n` the option for LAN node discovery. This will install the **Consumer** cluster and the **Provider** cluster.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Editing Flavors and PeeringCandidates

After the installation, proceed to modify the **flavors** offered by the Provider to the Consumer:

- Extract the necessary data from the ConfigMap:
  ```bash
  export KUBECONFIG=fluidos-provider-1-config
  kubectl get cm fluidos-network-manager-identity -n fluidos -o yaml
  ```
  Copy the following fields:
  - `domain`
  - `ip`
  - `nodeID`

- Edit the flavors in the `flavors/` folder by inserting the copied information. Replace the `ProviderID` field with the `nodeID` value extracted from the ConfigMap.

- Edit the **PeeringCandidates** in the `../peering_candidates_to_patch` folder with the same values obtained from the Provider.

## üóí Running the Demo

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run the First Script

- Navigate to the `Demo_da_presentare_last/` folder and execute the script:
  ```bash
  cd Demo_da_presentare_last/
  ./prima_parte.sh
  ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the Selected PeeringCandidate

- Check the active pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n fluidos
  ```

- View the controller logs (active after approximately 20 seconds):
  ```bash
  kubectl logs "controller_pod_name_on_consumer_side" -n fluidos
  ```

> **Note**: The verifier starts after 20 seconds.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the Reservation

- Modify the `reservation.yaml` file (located in `../../../deployments/node/samples`) with:
  - The **Provider** information (obtained from PeeringCandidates).
  - The **Consumer** information (obtained from the ConfigMap `fluidos-network-manager-identity`).

- Apply the file:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ../../../deployments/node/samples/reservation.yaml
  ```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Apply the Allocation

- Edit the `allocation.yaml` file to insert the contract name (retrievable with the following command):
  ```bash
  kubectl get contracts -n fluidos
  ```

- Apply the `allocation.yaml` file:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ../../../deployments/node/samples/allocation.yaml
  ```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Check Peering Status

- Check the peering status:
  ```bash
  liqoctl status peer
  ```

---

## üîÑ Changes on the Provider Side

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Change the KubeConfig Context

Switch to the Provider context:
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=../fluidos-provider-1-config
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Modify the Contract

Add the ConfigMap name in the `networkRequests` section, at the same level as `transactionId`:
```bash
kubectl edit contracts "contract_name" -n fluidos
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Second Script

To create the controller on the Provider and start the resource offload:
```bash
./seconda_parte.sh
```

---

## üîß Demonstration of Network Policies

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Access a Pod

To verify connectivity, start a shell on a pod:
```bash
kubectl exec -it "pod_name" -n "namespace_name" -- /bin/sh
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Connection

Use `wget` to test the connection to another pod:
```bash
wget "pod_ip_address_to_reach":"port"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

The controller is hosted on a Docker repository under **Salvatore**'s account. If you wish to upload it to your own repository, follow these steps:

1. Compile the project in the folder `translator/fluidos-security-orchestrator/fluidos-security-orchestrator` with the command:
   ```bash
   mvn package
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t yourDockerUsername/yourNewRepoName:Tag .
   ```

3. Push the image to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker push yourDockerUsername/yourNewRepoName:Tag
   ```

4. Update the `controller.yaml` file to point to the new Docker image.
